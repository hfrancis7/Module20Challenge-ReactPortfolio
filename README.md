# Module 20 Challenge - REACT Portfolio
  ![License:MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg) 

  ## Description
  
  I needed to make an online portfolio that showed off my skills as a web developer and help set me apart.
  
  I developed this single-page portfolio using REACT, a technology in which having skill in is highly saught after.
  
  This was a great way to practice REACT, which I haven't had exposure to much prior. This web page switches between layouts by conditionally rendering components rather than routing.
  
  I exclusively used my own CSS instead of using a CSS package such as Bootstrap or Tailwind for the sake of simplicity, especially after all of the new skills and time it took to make this project already. Bootstrap is listed as a dependency within the package.json, however, and this is because it was suggested to be installed for future use, along with axios and dotenv.
